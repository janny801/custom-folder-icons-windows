# Folder Icon Setter

This is a **Windows 11 batch script (.bat)** that allows you to change folder icons by applying a custom `.ico` file using a `desktop.ini` configuration.  
It automates the process of assigning custom icons to folders, sets the required attributes, and refreshes File Explorer so the new icon appears immediately.

You can use this to **visually organize folders** by applying personalized icons with minimal effort.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Applies custom icon via `desktop.ini`
- Automatically sets required folder attributes (`+s +r`)
- Hides `desktop.ini` after creation
- Restarts Windows Explorer to reflect changes
- Opens `desktop.ini` for manual verification (with Admin rights)

## üõ† How to Use

1. **Edit the Script:**

   Replace these two lines in the script with your actual paths:
   ```bat
   set folder=FULL_PATH_TO_TARGET_FOLDER
   set icon=FULL_PATH_TO_ICON_FILE.ico
    ```
2. **Save the Script as a `.bat` File:**

   Open Notepad, paste the script, and save it with a `.bat` extension (e.g., `set_folder_icon.bat`).  
   Be sure to select **"All Files"** as the file type when saving.

3. **Run the Script as Administrator:**

   Right-click the saved `.bat` file and choose **"Run as administrator"**.  
   This is required to modify system attributes and restart Explorer.

4. **Verify the Icon and Configuration:**

   The script will automatically open the `desktop.ini` file in Notepad (as Administrator).  
   Confirm it contains the correct icon path:
   ```ini
   [.ShellClassInfo]
   IconResource=FULL_PATH_TO_ICON_FILE.ico,0
    ```

## üìÅ Example

```bat
set folder=C:\Users\YourName\Documents\MyFolder
set icon=D:\icoFiles\customIcon.ico
```

**Explanation:**

- `set folder=...` is the full path to the folder where you want to apply the new icon.
- `set icon=...` is the path to your `.ico` file (the custom icon you want to use).

When you run the script with these paths:

- It deletes any old icon setting (`desktop.ini`) from the folder.
- Writes a new `desktop.ini` file that tells Windows to use your `.ico` file.
- Applies required attributes so Windows respects the settings.
- Restarts File Explorer so the change shows right away.
- Opens `desktop.ini` in Notepad (as Admin) so you can check that everything looks correct.
