# Folder Icon Setter

This is a **Windows 11 batch script (.bat)** that allows you to change folder icons by applying a custom `.ico` file using a `desktop.ini` configuration.  
It automates the process of assigning custom icons to folders, sets the required attributes, and refreshes File Explorer so the new icon appears immediately.

You can use this to **visually organize folders** by applying personalized icons with minimal effort.
